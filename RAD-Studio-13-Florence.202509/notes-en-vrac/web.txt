# WebStencils

WebStencils server-side script-based integration and processing of HTML files, to develop modern websites based on any JavaScript library, powered by the data extracted and processed by a RAD Studio server-side application. This is a sophisticated architecture introduced in RAD Studio 12.2, significantly extended in 13 with support for session data, global variables, a new switch statement, integrated WebBroker sessions authentication and authorization, direct access to dataset properties.

Use the WebStencils components, TWebStencilsProcessor and TWebStencilsEngine, to customize the template engine, control the file locations and the URL mapping, define URL parameters, and pass objects, datasets and collections to the scripts. The TWebStencilProcessor component implements the same interface of the old TPageProducer used in WebBroker and DataSnap and can replace it.
